# Machine-Learning-in-R-DSIM606
Here I will share the code that I go over in the class I teach with Machine Learning in R
I primarily do labs on the lending club data set. I also go over the code in the Brett Lantz book in Machine Learning in R 2023
I like this book because it has come out after the advent of generative AI which is the bane of existence for professors but great for industry
